============

A media access control (MAC) address is a 48-bit hexadecimal string.  The first eight bits of a MAC address determine many of its properties.

random-mac is a fun, little experiment that uses machine learning (binary classification) to evaluate these properties and identify randomly-generated MAC addresses.
